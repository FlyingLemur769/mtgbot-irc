**Why is MTGBot now named TheMTGBot?**

Sadly, my danbopes and mtgbot accounts were banned (Read more about it below), and I've had to hand my codebase over to a good friend of mine, to continue while I'm away from Twitch. If you need support, I highly recommend you put in a ticket [here](https://github.com/danbopes/mtgbot-irc/issues), and we will be happy to take a look into it. Unfortunately, because of my ban, I will not able to provide any support from within channels on Twitch. I do apologize for the inconvenience this causes.

**What was the ban about?**

Back when I was attempting to become a Twitch Administrator, I was frustrated with how things were handled in my case, and I stupidly streamed non gaming content in order to get banned (And it worked). Unfortunately for me, I created additional accounts in order to evade this ban without ever resolving this original ban, which resulted in the situation getting much worse. I've attempted to make amends to the staff/admins, and they've asked me to wait 6 months of abiding by their rules before I can appeal again. During this time, I will attempt to support Roland in running MTGBot, and will abide by twitches terms of service by not evading my ban.

**Who is running MTGBot now?**

His name is Roland (mtgratingtester). You may have seen him lurking on Reddit, or read his draft stats on mtggoldfish. You can find him on twitch [here](http://twitch.tv/mtgratingtester), or on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/mtgratingtester). He helped me with the original MTGO integration with the !rating command, and has been instrumental with making MTGBot what it is today.

**Can I still contact Danbopes?**

I'm still available on twitter [@danbopes](http://twitter.com/danbopes), but I will not be around in Twitch chat until my ban is lifted.

**Why is !`cardname` no longer working?**

I decided that with so many bots in channels now-a-days (moobot, nightbot, fishbot, etc...), this functionality conflicted a lot with commands of these bots. Now, you will need to prefix the cardname with !card or !oracle, and it should work like normal. To renable this functionality, you can type `!defaultcommand !card`.
